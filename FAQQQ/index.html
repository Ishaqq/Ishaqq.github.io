                      <h3>1. How do I make a live stream?</h3>
               <p>You can broadcast on Streamkar from either an iPhone or an Android phone.</p>
               <p>• Tap the round camera button in the center at the bottom of the main page.</p>

               <h3>2. How do I get more viewers in my live stream?</h3>
               <p>The best way to gain viewers in your broadcast is to:</p>
               <p>•
                  Promote your broadcasts by sharing the link on other social networks, 
                  such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat, and invite your 
                  friends to watch before you go live.
               </p>
               <h3>3. How do I delete a replay that I created?</h3>

               <p>If
                  your network is not very stable, you may encounter a broadcast where 
                  only your own comments are visible. When that happens, either while you 
                  are watching or making a broadcast, you can try exiting the broadcast 
                  and re-entering to get it fixed.

                       <h3>1. How do I get on the Leaderboard of Streamkar?</h3>
               <p>The
                  leaderboard, which is updated daily, shows broadcasters who have earned
                  the highest number of diamonds within the past 24-hour period.
               </p>
               <h3>2. How do Trending People &amp; Tags work?</h3>
               <p>Trending people/tags is another indicator of a broadcaster's popularity and in turn translates to more exposure.</p>
               <p>As
                  users and tags become more popular, they move up the trending list to 
                  become more visible to viewers. Broadcasters and hashtags on Streamkar 
                  trend with a variety of factors, including but not limited to:
               </p>
               <p>1. Total likes</p>
               <p>2. Broadcast activity (comments, likes, and gifts, etc.)</p>
               <p>3. Number of viewers</p>
               <p>4. How quickly likes accumulate</p>
               <p>5. Broadcast length</p>
               <h3>3. What are levels, and how do I level up?</h3>
               <p>On
                  Streamkar, your level represents your status and experience on the app. 
                  As your level increases, additional perks and features become available.
                  Leveling up is accomplished by:
               </p>
               <p>Broadcasting:</p>
               <p>• The more you broadcast, the quicker you progress</p>
               <p>Active Viewing:</p>
               <p>• Chatting</p>
               <p>• Giving gifts</p>
               <p>Sharing:</p>
               <p>• Promoting broadcasters on social media</p>
               <p>Social Networks Integration:</p>
               <p>•
                  The higher your level, the richer your experience on Streamkar. You will 
                  gain access to new gifts and receive coin discounts. Whether you're just
                  getting started or are an experienced broadcaster, there's always 
                  something new waiting for you at the next level!

                       <h3>1. How do I unblock someone I blocked by mistake?</h3>
               <p>To
                  unblock someone you've blocked by mistake, simply navigate to your 
                  profile page---Settings---Block list---Unblock then you can remove him 
                  from the “Block list”.
               </p>
               <h3>2. How do I block someone?</h3>
               <p>If
                  you notice inappropriate behavior, bullying, or any other rule-breaking
                  conduct on Streamkar, you may block a user from chatting on your 
                  broadcast and profile by tapping on their name, navigating to the 
                  profile page, and then choosing "block."

               <h3>3. I've been suspended. What does that mean?</h3>
               <p>If
                  you are suspended, you are temporarily banned from using most of

               </p>
               <h3>4. What is the difference between a ban and a suspension?</h3>
               <p>The
                  difference between a suspension and ban is that a suspension is 
                  temporary and reversible, whereas a ban is final and permanent. 
                  Suspension of an account typically lasts between 15 minutes and 48 
                  hours, depending on the severity of the offense.

                  are banned for violating Streamkar's rules and policies. Being banned 
                  means you are no longer able to log into your account. If you would like

                        <h3>1. How do I start streaming?</h3>
                 <p>Just click the camera in the upper right-hand corner of the app main page. If you haven’t already, you will be asked to go through a verification process. After submitting your documents and information, your information will be forward to our talent agency for approval. If approved, you will be notified. After this, hit the camera button and you will be ready to go live.</p>
                       <h3>2. How do I get more viewers in my live stream?</h3>
                 <p>The best way to gain viewers in your broadcast is to:
         </p>
         <p>• Promote your broadcasts by sharing the link on other social networks, such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat, and invite your friends to watch before you go live.</p>
                 <h3>3. There are too many comments. Can I remove them?</h3>
                 <p>You can swipe across the screen from the left to the right to clear all information pertaining to comments and gifts.</p>

                       <h3>1. What are Coins?</h3>
                 <p>Coins are the virtual currency of the Streamkar platform. They can be used to send gifts to Streamkar talents, join 1v1 chat, purchase VIP packages or user any other service available on our platform.</p>
                 <h3>2. How much are coins worth?</h3>
                 <p>Rps. 100=5000 coins.</p>
                 <h3>3. How can I top up my account?</h3>
                 <p>On your user profile page, click the the “Top-up”button immediately beneath your profile picture on the left-hand side. In here, you can choose to use PayPal, Google Pay and a variety of payment methods local to your country to top up your account. Follow their respective platform prompts and you will be topped up in no time!</p>
                 <h3>4. What if I don't have a supported payment method?</h3>
                 <p>If you have purchased coins on Streamkar but they have not showed up in your account, we are happy to help. Please provide us the receipt from either the App Store or Google Play store as well as a screenshot of your profile page for us to track your order quickly. </p>
                 <h3>5. I bought coins, but never received them!</h3>
                 <p>Then unfortunately you cannot top up at this time. We are providing as many local payment methods as possible to reach the greatest audience. </p>
                 <h3>6. What if I don't have a supported payment method?</h3>
                 <p>Then unfortunately you cannot top up at this time. We are providing as many local payment methods as possible to reach the greatest audience. </p>
                 <h3>7. What can I do with my diamonds I earn while streaming?</h3>
                 <p>When another user or a talent sends you a gift, you will receive diamonds. These diamonds can be exchanged in-app for virtual currency coins. Find the prompt for exchanging diamonds to coins on the “Me” page by clicking the “Earnings”box.</p>
                   <h3>7. As a user, can I convert the coins I have earned to real-life currency?</h3>
                 <p>Sorry. We currently do not support this function. If you would like to cash out your coins for the real-life currency of your country/region, you must first become a StreamKar talent and have signed with an officially recognized StreamKar agency. If you so desire, please contact our customer service and we will help. We look forward to it.</p>
                  <h3>8. As a signed talent, when can I receive my gift revenue?</h3>
                 <p>Generally, at StreamKar, we will pay gift revenue for a previous month within 5 working days of the beginning of the subsequent month.* However, if any of the various payment platforms supported by StreamKar delay the funds for any reason, we will wait until those funds clear to complete the requested transaction.</p>
            <p> *If a user seeks refund of funds spent through Apple Pay within the 3 month clearance period, the virtual currency amount corresponding to the requested refund amount will be frozen and deducted from any talent that has received virtual currency gifts sent using the refunded funds. As deemed necessary, certain payment methods may be temporarily discontinued or virtual coin distribution will be paid on a by-stage basis to protect against malicious refund requests.</p>
