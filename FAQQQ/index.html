                      <h3>1. How do I make a live stream?</h3>
               <p>You can broadcast on Streamkar from either an iPhone or an Android phone.</p>
               <p>• Tap the round camera button in the center at the bottom of the main page.</p>
               <p>• Title your broadcast with hashtags so that people with same interests can find you easily.</p>
               <h3>2. How do I get more viewers in my live stream?</h3>
               <p>The best way to gain viewers in your broadcast is to:</p>
               <p>•
                  Promote your broadcasts by sharing the link on other social networks, 
                  such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat, and invite your 
                  friends to watch before you go live.
               </p>
               <h3>3. How do I delete a replay that I created?</h3>

                  recording”, tap the recording at the top right corner and select

               </p>
               <h3>4. There are too many comments. Can I remove them?</h3>

                      <h3>1. How do I buy Coins?</h3>
               <p>You
                  may purchase coins by visiting your profile page and tapping on 
                  “Coins”. You can also purchase by tapping on the gift box icon in a 
                  broadcast and then choosing the “Charge” option. 
               </p>
               <h3>2. What are Coins and Diamonds?</h3>
               <p>Coins
                  are the Streamkar currency. Viewers and broadcasters can buy coins and 
                  use them to purchase gifts or do coin drops to interact with one 
                  another. When viewers send you gifts, you immediately earn the same 
                  number of diamonds as the item cost to purchase in the Streamkar Gift 
                  Store. Once you have enough diamonds, you can cash them out for real 
                  money or convert them back into coins. For a tutorial, please visit:

               <h3>3. I bought coins, but never received them!</h3>
               <p>If
                  you have purchased coins on Streamkar but they have not showed up in your
                  account, we are happy to help. Please provide us the receipt from 
                  either the App Store or Google Play store as well as a screenshot of 
                  your profile page for us to track your order quickly.
               </p>
               <h3>4. Why have some gift options disappeared from the Gift Shop?</h3>
               <p>We
                  have many gift ideas, but due to the limited availability of the gift 
                  shop slots, we may replace some gifts with new ones from time to time. 
                  Please try out the new ones that are equally fun!
               </p>

               <h3>6. Why was my withdrawal request rejected?</h3>
               <p>It can be due to a variety of reasons.</p>
               <p>1.The
                  Paypal account you provided is either incorrect or unregistered. Please
                  check and try again. Always provide your email associated with your 
                  PayPal instead of the phone number.
               </p>
               <p>2.Each user can withdraw a maximum of US$600 per day. Please wait until the next day to submit another request.</p>

               <h3>7. What is a coin drop/giveaway?</h3>
               <p>A
                  coin drop is the Treasure Chest gift item, but unlike a normal gift, 
                  this allows for coins to be distributed amongst the audience. You can 
                  start a coin drop at the cost of 600 coins during anyone's broadcast, 
                  including yours. The 600 coins will be won by and randomly distributed 
                  to the first ten users in the same broadcast who click the "Snatch" 
                  button. 
               </p>
               <h3>8. Only a few people participated in my coin drop. Are my coins wasted/lost?</h3>
               <p>You
                  can take a look at the coin drop results page to find out who the lucky
                  winners are. All coins that are not claimed within 24 hours will be 
                  automatically returned to the original coin dropper. 
               </p>
               <h3>9. When can I receive my cash out money?</h3>
               <p>In
                  addition to Streamkar's internal auditing process, some payment requests 
                  may also be subject to PayPal's 21-day temporary hold. Please allow at 
                  least 30 days for your payment to go through completely.
