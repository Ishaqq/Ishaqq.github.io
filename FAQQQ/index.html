                    <h3>How much are coins worth?</h3>
                    <p>Rps. 100=5000 coins.</p>
                      <h3>1. How do I buy Coins?</h3>
               <p>You may purchase coins by visiting your profile page and tapping on “Topup”. 
               </p>
               <h3>2. What are Coins and Diamonds?</h3>
               <p>Coins are the virtual currency of the Streamkar platform. They can be used to send gifts to Streamkar talents, join 1v1 chat, purchase VIP packages or user any other service available on our platform. Once you have enough diamonds, you can convert them back into coins. 
               </p>
               <h3>3. I bought coins, but never received them!</h3>
               <p>If you have purchased coins on Streamkar but they have not showed up in your account, we are happy to help. Please provide us the receipt from Easy Paisa, App Store , Google Play store,  as well as a screenshot of your profile page for us to track your order quickly.
               </p>
               <h3>4. Why have some gift options disappeared from the Gift Shop?</h3>
               <p>We have many gift ideas, but due to the limited availability of the gift shop slots, we may replace some gifts with new ones from time to time. Please try out the new ones that are equally fun! 
               </p>
               
               <h3>5. What can I do with my diamonds I earn while streaming?</h3>
               <p>When another user or a talent sends you a gift, you will receive diamonds. These diamonds can be exchanged for virtual currency coins. Find the prompt for exchanging diamonds to coins on the “Me” page by clicking the “Earnings” box.  
               </p>
               <h3>6. As a user, can I convert the coins I have earned to real-life currency?</h3>
               <p>Sorry. We currently do not support this function. If you would like to cash out your coins for the real-life currency of your country/region, you must first become a StreamKar talent and have signed with an officially recognized StreamKar agency. If you so desire, please contact our customer service and we will help. We look forward to it.

                      <h3>1. As a talent, when I send a cash bag, how many bags are being sent out?</h3>
               <p>The talent cash bag is different than the user cash bag in that the talent cash bag cannot select amount being sent out. The amount of bags that will be sent is just a random amount for talents. 
               </p>   
               <h3>2. What is a horn cash bag?</h3>
               <p>Selecting the “horn” option to accompany your cash bag will allow the cash bag to appear above any other cash bags and messages on the screen. Ideally, this option can be used during a time that many cash bags are being sent so you can be noticed and appreciated by other fans and talents.
               </p>
               <h3>3. What does “Quantity” mean in the cash bag menu?</h3>
               <p>Quantity refers to the number of cash bags that users will be able to grab. The total amount you wish to send will be divided randomly among the quantity of bags you send out. For instance, if you send 10,000 coins with a quantity of 15 bags, that means your 10,000 coins will be divided among 15 bags and that 15 users each can get a portion of those 10,000 coins.
               </p>    
               <h3>4. As a talent, when I send a cash bag, how many bags are being sent out?</h3>
