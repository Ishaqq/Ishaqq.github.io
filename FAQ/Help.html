               <h3>1. How do I make a live stream?</h3>
               <p>You can broadcast on Streamkar from either an iPhone or an Android phone.</p>
               <p>• Tap the round camera button in the center at the bottom of the main page.</p>
               <p>• Title your broadcast with hashtags so that people with same interests can find you easily.</p>
               <h3>2. How do I get more viewers in my live stream?</h3>
               <p>The best way to gain viewers in your broadcast is to:</p>
               <p>•
                  Promote your broadcasts by sharing the link on other social networks, 
                  such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat, and invite your 
                  friends to watch before you go live.
               </p>
               <h3>3. How do I delete a replay that I created?</h3>
               <p>To
                  delete a recording, you need to go to your profile page, click “My 
                  recording”, tap the recording at the top right corner and select 
                  "delete."
               </p>
               <h3>4. There are too many comments. Can I remove them?</h3>
               <p>You can swipe across the screen from the left to the right to clear all information pertaining to comments and gifts.</p>
               <h3>5. Why is my camera or mic not working?</h3>
               <p>You
                  must give Streamkar permission to use your camera and/or microphone on 
                  your mobile device. Please go to Settings –&gt; Streamkar –&gt; Privacy, 
                  and make sure both camera and microphone are enabled.

               <h3>1. How do I buy Coins?</h3>
               <p>You
                  may purchase coins by visiting your profile page and tapping on 
                  “Coins”. You can also purchase by tapping on the gift box icon in a 
                  broadcast and then choosing the “Charge” option. 
               </p>
               <h3>2. What are Coins and Diamonds?</h3>
               <p>Coins
                  are the Streamkar currency. Viewers and broadcasters can buy coins and 
                  use them to purchase gifts or do coin drops to interact with one 
                  another. When viewers send you gifts, you immediately earn the same 
                  number of diamonds as the item cost to purchase in the Streamkar Gift 
                  Store. Once you have enough diamonds, you can cash them out for real 
                  money or convert them back into coins. For a tutorial, please visit: 
                  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_dmDvFdb3Y
               </p>
               <h3>3. I bought coins, but never received them!</h3>
               <p>If
                  you have purchased coins on Streamkar but they have not showed up in your
                  account, we are happy to help. Please provide us the receipt from 
                  either the App Store or Google Play store as well as a screenshot of 
                  your profile page for us to track your order quickly.
               </p>
               <h3>4. Why have some gift options disappeared from the Gift Shop?</h3>
               <p>We
                  have many gift ideas, but due to the limited availability of the gift 
                  shop slots, we may replace some gifts with new ones from time to time. 
                  Please try out the new ones that are equally fun!
               </p>

               <h3>6. Why was my withdrawal request rejected?</h3>
               <p>It can be due to a variety of reasons.</p>
               <p>1.The
                  Paypal account you provided is either incorrect or unregistered. Please
                  check and try again. Always provide your email associated with your 
                  PayPal instead of the phone number.
               </p>
               <p>2.Each user can withdraw a maximum of US$600 per day. Please wait until the next day to submit another request.</p>

               <h3>7. What is a coin drop/giveaway?</h3>
               <p>A
                  coin drop is the Treasure Chest gift item, but unlike a normal gift, 
                  this allows for coins to be distributed amongst the audience. You can 
                  start a coin drop at the cost of 600 coins during anyone's broadcast, 
                  including yours. The 600 coins will be won by and randomly distributed 
                  to the first ten users in the same broadcast who click the "Snatch" 
                  button. 
               </p>
               <h3>8. Only a few people participated in my coin drop. Are my coins wasted/lost?</h3>
               <p>You
                  can take a look at the coin drop results page to find out who the lucky
                  winners are. All coins that are not claimed within 24 hours will be 
                  automatically returned to the original coin dropper. 
               </p>
               <h3>9. When can I receive my cash out money?</h3>
               <p>In
                  addition to Streamkar's internal auditing process, some payment requests 
                  may also be subject to PayPal's 21-day temporary hold. Please allow at 
                  least 30 days for your payment to go through completely.

               <p>If
                  your network is not very stable, you may encounter a broadcast where 
                  only your own comments are visible. When that happens, either while you 
                  are watching or making a broadcast, you can try exiting the broadcast

               <h3>1. How do I get on the Leaderboard of Streamkar?</h3>
               <p>The
                  leaderboard, which is updated daily, shows broadcasters who have earned
                  the highest number of diamonds within the past 24-hour period.
               </p>
               <h3>2. How do Trending People &amp; Tags work?</h3>
               <p>Trending people/tags is another indicator of a broadcaster's popularity and in turn translates to more exposure.</p>
               <p>As
                  users and tags become more popular, they move up the trending list to 
                  become more visible to viewers. Broadcasters and hashtags on Streamkar 
                  trend with a variety of factors, including but not limited to:
               </p>
               <p>1. Total likes</p>
               <p>2. Broadcast activity (comments, likes, and gifts, etc.)</p>
               <p>3. Number of viewers</p>
               <p>4. How quickly likes accumulate</p>
               <p>5. Broadcast length</p>
               <h3>3. What are levels, and how do I level up?</h3>
               <p>On
                  Streamkar, your level represents your status and experience on the app. 
                  As your level increases, additional perks and features become available.
                  Leveling up is accomplished by:
               </p>
               <p>Broadcasting:</p>
               <p>• The more you broadcast, the quicker you progress</p>
               <p>Active Viewing:</p>
               <p>• Chatting</p>
               <p>• Giving gifts</p>
               <p>Sharing:</p>
               <p>• Promoting broadcasters on social media</p>
               <p>Social Networks Integration:</p>
               <p>•
                  The higher your level, the richer your experience on Streamkar. You will 
                  gain access to new gifts and receive coin discounts. Whether you're just
                  getting started or are an experienced broadcaster, there's always 
                  something new waiting for you at the next level!

                  difference between a suspension and ban is that a suspension is 
                  temporary and reversible, whereas a ban is final and permanent. 
                  Suspension of an account typically lasts between 15 minutes and 48 
                  hours, depending on the severity of the offense.
               </p>

               <h3>6. Why am I unable to use the app for my age?</h3>
               <p>We
                  prohibit children under 13 from broadcasting. If you are over 13 and 
                  still cannot use Streamkar, please provide us with your government-issued 
                  photo ID as proof of age.

               <h3>7. I've been banned. What does that mean?</h3>
               <p>Users
                  are banned for violating Streamkar's rules and policies. Being banned 
                  means you are no longer able to log into your account. If you would like
                  to dispute a ban, you may e-mail us at <span class="mail">Streamkar@cmcm.com</span>.

                   <h3>7. As a user, can I convert the coins I have earned to real-life currency?</h3>
                 <p>Sorry. We currently do not support this function. If you would like to cash out your coins for the real-life currency of your country/region, you must first become a StreamKar talent and have signed with an officially recognized StreamKar agency. If you so desire, please contact our customer service and we will help. We look forward to it.</p>
                  <h3>8. As a signed talent, when can I receive my gift revenue?</h3>
                 <p>Generally, at StreamKar, we will pay gift revenue for a previous month within 5 working days of the beginning of the subsequent month.* However, if any of the various payment platforms supported by StreamKar delay the funds for any reason, we will wait until those funds clear to complete the requested transaction.</p>
            <p> *If a user seeks refund of funds spent through Apple Pay within the 3 month clearance period, the virtual currency amount corresponding to the requested refund amount will be frozen and deducted from any talent that has received virtual currency gifts sent using the refunded funds. As deemed necessary, certain payment methods may be temporarily discontinued or virtual coin distribution will be paid on a by-stage basis to protect against malicious refund requests.</p>
